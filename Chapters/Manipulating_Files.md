### Pipelines

* A ***pipeline*** is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the ***pipe*** ("|"). A ***pipe*** connects the standard output of the first command to the standard input of the next command.

  * ```bash
    [user@host ~]$ ls | wc -l
    ```

* The ***tee*** command allows to write the output of the command (stdout) to a file AND to send it to the second pipe.

  * ```bash
    [user@host ~]$ ls -l | tee /tmp/saved-output | less
    ```
